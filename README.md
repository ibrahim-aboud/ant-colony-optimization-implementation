# ant-colony-optimization-implementation
This repo contains an attempt to implement different variations of the ant colony optimization algorithm, applied to the flow shop problem, the language used is python

First of all, implemented the ant system "elitist variation", in addition to a visualisation of the pheromon density variation on different arcs of the graph through time "iterations"
